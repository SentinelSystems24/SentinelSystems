    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Usage Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        Guild Owners who invite, or allow to be invited on their behalf, the Sentinel Systems bot agree to the terms outlined in this document, including those provided on the 
        <a href="https://sentinelsystems.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentinel Systems Website</a>, such as the Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        All users who invite the bot may have precise data collected as outlined in the Privacy Policy. This data is necessary for the Sentinel Systems bot to perform its core functionalities, including command usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        By inviting the Sentinel Systems bot, users acknowledge and agree that Sentinel Systems reserves the right to revoke or suspend permissions to invite or use the bot if users are found in breach of these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or Discord Community Guidelines as outlined by Discord Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sentinel Systems reserves the right to hold Guild Owners accountable for the communities they manage.

      <h2>The Intended User / Guild</h2>
      <p>
        The Sentinel Systems bot is intended for users who comply with the Discord Community Guidelines as outlined by Discord Inc. Users not complying with these guidelines may not use the Sentinel Systems bot, and doing so constitutes a breach of these Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bot is not intended for use in dedicated NSFW (Not Safe for Work) guilds. Inviting Sentinel Systems to such guilds constitutes a breach of these terms. Guilds with fewer than three NSFW channels may be exempt. All NSFW channels within guilds using the bot must remain legally compliant, or the guild will be in breach of these terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Associates and Affiliations</h2>
      <p>
        Sentinel Systems does not claim, and has never claimed, to be affiliated with any other service provider, law enforcement agency, governing body, or Discord Inc. Associates of Sentinel Systems, including partners, do not speak on behalf of Sentinel Systems and are independent entities, except for River Development.

      </p>
      <p>
        Sentinel Systems reserves the right to update these terms at the discretion of the management team, providing a minimum of 5 working days' notice before changes are finalized. Users may opt out by removing the bot from their guild or contacting support.
